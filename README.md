This is a graphics Project which involves:
1) A from-scratch flight simulator written in OpenGL
2) Some OpenCV code which interprets the positions of puff balls and pipe cleaners to build a rigid 3D model of standard basis vectors.

Will it change the world?  Maybe not.
Was is absurdly fun to fly a pipe-cleaner plane and make engine noises?  Very much so.
